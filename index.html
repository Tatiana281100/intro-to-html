            <h2 class="me">About Me</h2>

            <p class="one"> I always loved arts, colors and creativity. Graphic design, painting, drawing –
            they are my way of expressing myself and let my ideas flow. Music is also a big
            part of my life, I can’t go a day without it, and if I hear a good song, I just
            have to dance. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 8, but honestly,
            it never stopped me from doing anything I wanted. There is too much to discover
            in this world, and I love learning new things every day, even if sometimes it’s
            a challenge.</p>

            <p class="two">Since I was young, I felt a deep connection with animals and nature. There is
            something special about leaving technology aside and just enjoying the beauty
            of the world, whether it’s a forest walk or just watching birds in the park.
            A good book can do the same, transport me to another world, and I also enjoy
            spending time with my family. Many people think appearance is everything, but when
            they get to know me, they realize tattoos don’t define who someone really is.</p>

            <blockquote><p>"The scars I carry are not marks of defeat, but witnesses of my courage.
                Every step I take forward proves that darkness does not define my story."</p>
